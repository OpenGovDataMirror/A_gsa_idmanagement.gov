## General Practices

This content is vendor-neutral. You should not submit marketing materials for commercial products. If you want to contribute a page or content that includes commercial products and specific references for development and engineering, please review the commercial product trademark or copyright guides from the product vendor and reference those guides in your pull request.

## Plain Language

Consider the audience when you submit content. Plain language benefits a broad audience. Review your proposed content for the use of acronyms and specialized jargon before submitting.

- Make each page brief.
- Use titles to help the user identify jump-off points for information.
- Write short paragraphs.
- Write in plain language and active voice as much as possible.
- Use numbered steps, bullet lists, and graphics.

The following are useful resources for plain language, writing, and style:

- [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}
- [Federal Plain Language Guidelines](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

## Thanks

The contributing framework, the licensing framework, and the idea for providing this content as open-source are based on work from [the 18F office](https://18f.gsa.gov/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

To submit an issue, you must first [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. We recommend that you [configure two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for your GitHub account.

## Add a Page

Before you add a new page, see the list of existing issues. You can add a new issue to propose a topic, or comment on an existing issue. By creating or discussing an issue, you can clarify a problem, identify a solution, and propose a format for a new page. When youâ€™re ready, comment on the related issue that you want to write the new page.

To add a page and open a pull request, you must first [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. We recommend that you [configure two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for your GitHub account.

First you must **create a page**.

1. (Optional) If you want to begin with a template page, navigate to the [Page Template](https://github.com/GSA/idmanagement.gov/blob/staging/page-template.md){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

3. Copy the content of the template.

4. Navigate to the ficam-management/pages folder, and in the upper right corner, click the **Create new file** button.
	
5. At the top of the screen, enter a name for your new page with the extension **.md**.

	The **.md** extension identifies a markdown file.
	
6. In the body of the file, paste the content that you copied in step 3.

	Use this template as a guideline for your page.

## Submit a Page

1. Scroll to the **Commit new file** box.

	The **Open a pull request** page appears.
	
5. If there is a corresponding issue that identifies a need for this page, include the issue number in the description.

	The site administrators receive a notification about the new page, and they can review and publish the page.
