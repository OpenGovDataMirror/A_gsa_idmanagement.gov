Certificate policy and keyPurposeID OIDs are configured one time – at the start of testing.  All 269 test cases are run with those same OIDs configured unless a test case specifically calls for a bogus OID to be substituted.

[See 6.1.1 (c),  “user-initial-policy-set” in RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6.1.1){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for more information.
