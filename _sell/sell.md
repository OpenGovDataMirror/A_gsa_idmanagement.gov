If you are a vendor who wishes to sell identity, credentialing, and access management (ICAM) products and services, or provide consulting services, to the federal government, learn how to get your product or service tested and approved.

Federal agencies require systems and services to be functional, secure, and compatible with other products. The Federal ICAM (FICAM) program supports these requirements by managing the testing of certain products and by certifying services.

## Product Approval Process

It only takes three steps to get a product approved for use by federal agencies:

1. Review testing documents
2. Contact a testing lab
3. Get on a GSA Schedule

### Step 1 – Review Testing Documents

The FICAM testing program, also known as the [Federal Information Processing Standard 201 (FIPS 201) Evaluation Program](../../fips201/), tests [commercial products](https://www.acquisition.gov/far/2.101){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} used in Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentialing systems, Physical Access Control Systems (PACS), and public key infrastructures (PKI).

Review the applicable testing document(s) for the product(s) you wish to have tested. Products we test include PIV cards and Physical Access Control Systems (PACS).

[Review testing documents and procedures](../../fips201/)

### Step 2 – Contact a Testing Lab

Once you’ve reviewed the testing documents, contact one of the Testing Labs listed below. They’ll walk you through the application and testing process.

There are three Approved Testing Labs that test PIV card stock:
- [atsec information security corporation](http://www.atsec.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} 
  - Contact: Andreas Fabis
  - Phone: (512) 615-7300
- [Booz Allen Hamilton Cyber Assurance Testing Laboratory](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/testing_labs/#24){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} 
  - Contact:  Eric Winterton
  - Phone: (410) 684-6691
- [Leidos](https://www.leidos.com/CC-FIPS140){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} 
  - Contact: Michael Powers
  - Phone: (443) 367-7422

GSA manages testing and certification for Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) as well as annual audit testing of production PIV credentials for federal agencies:

  - Contact: fips201ep at gsa.gov

After your product passes testing, you’ll receive a signed document showing the approval, and your product will be listed on the [Approved Products List (APL)](../buy#products).

### Step 3 – Get on a GSA Schedule

The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program, also referred to as the "Schedule," is the premier contract vehicle for the federal government. The Schedule Program is a long-term government-wide contract between commercial suppliers and the federal government. Holding a Schedule contract can open doors for businesses, but it requires effort and commitment on your part to succeed. [See if the Schedule is a good fit for your business first.](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/gsa-schedule/selling-through-schedule/prospective-schedule-contractors-is-the-schedule-a-good-fit-for-me){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

After testing and approval, apply to get your product or service listed on GSA’s Multiple Award Schedule (MAS).

- [Sell through GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS)](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100519){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}  – Agencies use the MAS to fulfill their technology products and services needs.

Please contact fips201ep at gsa.gov if you have product approval questions.

## Professional Services

Professional services involve integrating solutions and/or helping agencies deploy and operate identity and credentialing systems related to PIV and CAC implementations.

GSA certifies consulting services and labor categories through an acquisition schedule. The following Special Item Numbers (SINs) include ICAM or HSPD-12 professional services.

- [541519ICAM](https://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/sinDetails.do?scheduleNumber=MAS&specialItemNumber=541519ICAM&executeQuery=YES){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} – ICAM Solutions
- [541519PIV](https://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/sinDetails.do?scheduleNumber=MAS&specialItemNumber=541519PIV&executeQuery=YES){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} – HSPD-12 Products and Service Components

The Certified System Engineer ICAM PACS (CSEIP) is a certification related to PACS and integration services and is often a requirement to become an approved consultant.
